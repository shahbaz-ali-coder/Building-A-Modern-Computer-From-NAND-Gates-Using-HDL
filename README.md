# Building-A-Modern-Computer-From-NAND-Gates-Using-HDL
my 3rd Semester college mini project

Building up a Modern 16 bit computer from basic NAND gates using  HDL in which YOU can play games like Tetries and Pong .

Step 1:Download the zip file from Given tools and extract all the items in a single folder .


Step 2:To run a .hdl file, open "HardwareSimulator" from Needed Tools folder and load the .hdl script and test script then run to program 
       to see the output.
       
Step 3:To run a  .asm file,open "CPUEmulator" form Needed Tools foldes and load the .asm program and test script then run it.
       There you see the 512X256 size GUI.This "CPUEmulator" is synchronized with KeyBoard.
       If We run the "PONG.asm" in the CPUEmulator,we can see the Game appearing in the GUI and we can play the game using keyboard.
